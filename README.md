# Adaptive CartPole AI with Emotional Learning

## Overview
This project implements an advanced reinforcement learning agent that solves the CartPole environment using a unique combination of deep Q-learning and emotional state adaptation. The agent incorporates metacognitive feedback and emotional influences to enhance its learning process.

## Features
- **Emotional Learning System**: Dynamic emotional state adjustment based on rewards
  - Curiosity
  - Fear
  - Reward-seeking behavior
- **Advanced Neural Network Architecture**:
  - Multi-layer perceptron with dropout layers
  - Experience replay buffer
  - Target network for stable learning
- **Metacognitive Feedback Loop**: Real-time performance monitoring and adaptation
- **Visual Rendering**: Real-time visualization of the CartPole environment

## Technical Implementation
### Neural Network Architecture

python
class ImprovedNN(nn.Module):
def init(self, input_size=4, hidden_size=128, output_size=2):
super(ImprovedNN, self).init()
self.network = nn.Sequential(
nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
nn.ReLU(),
nn.Dropout(0.1),
nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size),
nn.ReLU(),
nn.Dropout(0.1),
nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
)


### Key Components
1. **Experience Replay Buffer**
   - Stores and samples past experiences
   - Enables batch learning
   - Capacity: 10,000 experiences

2. **Emotional State System**
   - Dynamic adjustment based on performance
   - Influences exploration vs exploitation
   - Affects reward scaling

3. **Training Parameters**
   - Learning rate: 0.0005
   - Batch size: 64
   - Epsilon decay: 0.995
   - Target network update frequency: 10 episodes

## Performance
- Achieves high scores (475+) in CartPole environment
- Stable learning through emotional adaptation
- Quick convergence to optimal policy

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenAI Gym
- Pygame (for visualization)
- NumPy


## How It Works
1. **Initialization**:
   - Sets up the CartPole environment
   - Initializes neural networks and emotional state
   - Prepares experience replay buffer

2. **Training Loop**:
   - Collects experiences through environment interaction
   - Updates emotional state based on rewards
   - Trains neural network using experience replay
   - Updates target network periodically

3. **Emotional Adaptation**:
   ```python
   def update_emotional_state(reward):
       if reward > 0:
           emotional_state['reward_seeking'] += 0.1
           emotional_state['fear'] = max(0, emotional_state['fear'] - 0.05)
           emotional_state['curiosity'] = min(1.0, emotional_state['curiosity'] + 0.02)
   ```
